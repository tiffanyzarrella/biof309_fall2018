Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program.
Week by week, we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of computer programming and the Python programming language.
There will be in-class demonstrations, using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/) and to a lesser extent [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), and activities to be completed outside of class, using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), for you to practice and learn at your own pace.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working Python programs
3. Understand the difference between Python object types (e.g. lists, dicts)
4. Perform data analysis and visualization with Python
5. Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaboration
6. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project

Communication
------------

**Before contacting us**, please check to see if your question has already been answered elsewhere, e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you cannot find the answer, please make sure to ask your question thoughtfully (https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and provide everything needed to answer e.g. code, error message, dataset, etc.

In general, please use the [course Slack workspace](https://biof309.slack.com) to communicate with classmates and instructors. If you have a course-relevant question or something to share, [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) is simply better than email. In case of personal/private question/concerns, please use [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) direct message (DM).

In case of an emergency, please send a DM on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) *and* an email.

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 13th of September 2018 and finishing on 13th of December 2018.

**Class Location: Rathskeller (Room B1A199C), Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus**

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other commitments may occasionally prevent attendance. If you miss a class, please review the materials available at the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marskar/biof309_fall2018) and keep up with activities and homework.

NEW THIS SEMESTER! We will be piloting REMOTE ATTENDANCE and CLASS RECORDINGS via [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeet.me/biof309) and [WebEx](https://cbiit.webex.com/join/skarzynskimw). These two options are largely the same, you can pick whichever platform you prefer. Please do **NOT** use this as excuse to skip class and just watch the recorded lectures! This course is **NOT** a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC), it will feature a great deal of group work. Additionally, forming groups to complete the final project is highly encouraged! Remote attendance will work best if you can meet with classmates to work through exercises together. We will do our best to answers questions in the [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeet.me/biof309) and [WebEx](https://cbiit.webex.com/join/skarzynskimw) chat windows during class. We will also try to answer all questions on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com), but please try to ask your questions during class, if at all possible.

Important FAES Fall 2018 semester dates:

* July 9 â€“ September 7: Online Registration.
* September 10 â€“ 28: Late Registration (10 dollar late fee per course applies).
* September 10: Classes begin.
* December 14: Classes end.

Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own laptop to each class.**

*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional feat.*

Please install the following programs **BEFORE** the first class:
1. The [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

    The Anaconda installer will automatically install most of the software we will use during the course, including [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html).

2. The [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

    The very nice folks at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) have given us free licenses for the Professional Edition of [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), the best (in my humble opinion) Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

    If you have a .edu email address, please install [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Professional using [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

    If not, a installation link will be distributed to you by email and made available on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com/).

During the first class, we will set up accounts on:

1. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)

    The very nice folks at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) have given us free 6 month access to their awesome Data VisualizationðŸ“Š, Machine LearningðŸ¤–, and Data Science learning materials.

    We will discuss the most interesting examples during class and point out others to be reviewed outside of class.

2. [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com)

    Thanks to the [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)-[PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com) partnership, we can get free 6 month access to Web Development, Object-Oriented Programming, and Test-Driven Development learning materials on [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com).

Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake Vanderplas. Both of these books are available free on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in Jupyter Notebook form. The code for [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but the text is only available in the printed copy of the book. For maximum enjoyment, consider working through the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way (ebook freely available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.
* [Think Python (ebook freely available from the author)](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) by Allen B. Downey.
* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python 3 (ebook freely available from the author)](https://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php) by Charles Severance.
* [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) by Kenneth Reitz and Tanya Schlusser.
* [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](www.automatetheboringstuff.com) by Al Sweigart.
* [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python) by Andreas Mueller and Sarah Guido.

Grading
-------

The emphasis of the course is on learning and mastering the skills covered. We hope that everyone will be able to complete one of the Python tracks on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) or [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com) and submit a final project via [GitHub](https://github.com/). If some of the material appears unclear, please ask for clarification.

Completion of the Python tracks on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) or [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com) will be graded in a binary manner (completed/incomplete).

Grading the __final project__ will be done using the following rubric:

  - Only comments embedded in the code (1-3)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings (4-6)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, additional standalone documentation (7-9)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, extensive standalone documentation with example usage (10-12)

* Readability
  - The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (1-3)
  - The code is readable, but challenging to understand (4-6)
  - The code is fairly easy to read (7-9)
  - The code is well organized and very easy to read (10-12)

* Reusability

  - The code is not organized for reusability (1-3)
  - Some parts of the code could be reused (4-6)
  - Most of the code could be reused (7-9)
  - Each part of the code, and the whole, could be reused (10-12)

* Performance

  - Program does not run (1-6)
  - Program runs, but does not produce correct output (7-12)
